# # Introduction

# This book is for those students who are interested in fireflies microbit, they can see the examples, codes and steps to learn about the fireflies microbit.
# This book also includes images, videos and python editor. 
# There are two examples of fireflies microbit in this book, it can help students to learn fireflies microbit.
# One example is students can press button A to flash microbit, for that we will need two computers and one power bank.
# Another example is students can use microbit without pressing anything, it will automatically flashing microbits.
# Students make the connections between abstract ideas and real world outcomes by working with software and hardware together to learn iot with microbits

# What you will learn? 


# - how to use radio communication between micro:bits to trigger events
# - that the micro:bit's LED display can be made brighter and dimmer
# - how to use random numbers and chance to mimic real-world behaviour

# # What is it?

# Fireflies are insects that use bioluminescence (light made in their bodies) to communicate with each other. 
# 
# Flash the program on at least three micro:bits in the same room. Press button A on any micro:bit and you should see a 'swarm' of micro:bits lighting up as they receive a radio message. It works best in a dark room with lots of micro:bits. 
# 
# Once a micro:bit has received the radio message it has a one in ten chance of transmitting its own radio message and starting another wave of glowing lights in the other micro:bits. 
# 
# When the lights eventually stop, press button A on any micro:bit to restart the 'swarm' of communication. 

# # What you need? 

# - at least 3 micro:bits, the more the better
# - micro:bit battery packs (optional)

# # Conclusion

# I have done all the steps and example, it was very interseting and fun, i hope you will also find it interesting and can able to do all the examples clearly
