# # Introduction

# This book is for those students who are interested in fireflies microbit, they can see the examples, codes and steps to learn about the fireflies microbit.
# This book also includes images, videos and python editor. 
# There are two examples of fireflies microbit in this book, it can help students to learn fireflies microbit.
# One example is students can press button A to flash microbit, for that we will need two computers and one power bank.

# # Learning Objective

# - learn microbit by pressing button A
# - learn microbit by not pressing any button, it will flash itself
# - learn using codes

# # What you will learn? 

# In[ ]:





# - how to use radio communication between micro:bits to trigger events
# - that the micro:bit's LED display can be made brighter and dimmer
# - how to use random numbers and chance to mimic real-world behaviour

# # What is it?

# Fireflies are insects that use bioluminescence (light made in their bodies) to communicate with each other. 
# 
# Flash the program on at least three micro:bits in the same room. Press button A on any micro:bit and you should see a 'swarm' of micro:bits lighting up as they receive a radio message. It works best in a dark room with lots of micro:bits. 
# 
# Once a micro:bit has received the radio message it has a one in ten chance of transmitting its own radio message and starting another wave of glowing lights in the other micro:bits. 
# 
# When the lights eventually stop, press button A on any micro:bit to restart the 'swarm' of communication. 

# # What you need? 

# - at least 3 micro:bits, the more the better
# - micro:bit battery packs (optional)

# ```{note} 
# you will need
# - 3 microbit
# - a battery pack (if necessary)
# ```
